> Dear Colleagues,
> 
> we would like to inform you that the registration to the International
> Doctorate School "Frontiers in Nuclear and Hadronic Physics 2026" (FNHP2026)
> is now open. The school will take place at the Galileo Galilei Institute
> (GGI) in Florence, from February 16 to February 28, 2026. The school is
> primarily addressed to Ph.D. students in Theoretical Nuclear and Hadronic
> Physics. Participation of post-doc fellows and experimentalist is also
> encouraged.
> 
> The 2026 edition will be devoted to the study of high-energy collisions from
> proton-proton to nucleus-nucleus and it will provide a pedagogical
> introduction to the basic concepts and tools needed for carrying out cutting
> edge research in hot QCD matter, high-energy QCD, Quark-Gluon Plasma probes
> and properties, relativistic hydrodynamics, particle production, QCD phase
> diagram at finite temperature and density. The topics will be of main
> interest for students and young post-docs working on hot QCD matter,
> relativistic heavy-ion collisions, quark matter in astrophysics, hadronic
> physics, and more generally on nuclear and particle physics. The lectures
> will emphasize the intimate connections among these fields, giving much
> attention to the interpretation of experimental data.
> 
> The program is as follows:
> 
> L. Apolinario(LIP Lisbon): Jet Physics in ultra-relativistic collisions 
> 
> N. Brambilla (Tech. Univ. of Munich): Non-Relativistic EFT and Lattice QCD
> for Heavy Flavor Dynamics
> 
> G. Giacalone (CERN, Geneva): Nuclear Structure studies through
> ultra-relativistic collisions
> 
> S. Schlichting (Bielefeld Univ.): Hydrodynamics and Kinetic Theory:
> Attractors and Thermalization
> 
> A. Vuorinen (Helsinki Univ.): Dense matter equation-of-state from colliders
> to neutron stars
> 
> We will admit about 50 students.  
> Accomodation in double rooms will be provided to a cost of about 40 Euro per
> night (including breakfast).  Lunches during the week-days will be offered
> on site, free of charge, to all participants. 
> Financial support for accommodation expenses may be provided, upon request,
> to a selected number of participants (about 35).
> 
> Students from non-EU institutes/universities are supposed to provide a
> [recommendation letter](GGI-FNHP2026-letter.pdf), to be sent to the School contact persons
> (andrea.beraudo@unito.it, greco@lns.infn.it).
> The deadline for application is December 18th, 2025. Acceptance will be
> communicated by January 9th, 2025.
> 
> More information and the application form can be found on the
> website https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=552.
