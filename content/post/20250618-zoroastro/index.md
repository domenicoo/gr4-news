Dear all,

It is with a heavy heart (and a slightly overheated CPU) that we announce the passing of zoroastro, our loyal SSH server and steadfast companion through login storms, accidental rm -rf, and infinite loops since time immemorial.

After years of noble serviceâ€”during which zoroastro survived kernel panics, mysterious downtime, and that one time someone tried to mine bitcoins (I'm not joking), our venerable server has finally ascended to the great /dev/null in the sky.

But fear not! From the ashes of zoroastro rises a worthy successor:  artaban is now ready to serve all your SSH-ing needs with dignity and RAM to spare.

Effective immediately, please direct your logins, scripts, and affection to:  
ðŸ‘‰ artaban.to.infn.it

the home directory contents are still there and aliases should redirect smoothly. But do check your scripts and cron jobs just in case.


Rest in peace, dear zoroastro you were the SSH server we didnâ€™t deserve but desperately needed.
