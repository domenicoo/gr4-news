> Dear Colleagues,
> 
> It is our great honour to announce that the 33rd International Workshop on
> Deep Inelastic Scattering and Related Topics (DIS2026) will be held in
> Bologna (Italy) from 4 to 8 May 2026. Find attached the First Bulletin.
> 
> DIS2026 is now the 33rd in an annual series of International Workshops. It
> will cover a broad range of topics related to Quantum Chromodynamics and
> Deep Inelastic Scattering, as well as the most exciting developments in
> high-energy physics. A significant part of the programme is devoted to the
> most recent theoretical advances and results from large experiments at BNL,
> CERN, DESY, FNAL, JLab and KEK. 
> 
> The venue of the workshop is the Royal Hotel Carlton Conference Centre,
> located in Bologna city centre. Participation will be in person only. The
> DIS conference is back in Bologna after 25 years: the 9th edition was held
> in Bologna in 2001.
> 
> The scientific programme will start on Monday morning and conclude on Friday
> afternoon. It will feature plenary sessions with invited talks on Monday and
> Friday, as well as six parallel sessions with contributed talks the other
> days. Short “flash” talks will also be included in the parallel sessions,
> providing visibility to the work of young scientists and fostering further
> discussion during breaks. A preliminary version of the programme is already
> available on the conference website, https://dis2026.infn.it.
> 
> As in previous editions, the 2026 Guido Altarelli Award will be presented
> during DIS2026. The Guido Altarelli Award honours the memory of the late
> Guido Altarelli, one of the founding fathers of QCD, an outstanding
> communicator of particle physics, and a mentor and strong supporter of Early
> Career Scientists. The Guido Altarelli Award includes a certificate and a
> monetary prize. It is awarded to young scientists for outstanding scientific
> contributions to the fields covered by the DIS Conference series. Deadline
> for nominations is 20th November 2025.
> 
> The Workshop proceedings will be published on Proceedings of Science. Daily
> on-site lunches and coffee breaks, a welcome reception and a conference
> dinner are included in the conference fee and will promote opportunities for
> informal interaction and scientific exchange. The social excursion on
> Thursday afternoon — a guided walking tour through Bologna’s historic centre
> — will offer participants a chance to discover the city’s rich cultural and
> architectural heritage.
> 
> The Workshop is jointly organised by the Bologna and Ferrara Divisions of
> the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), the Department of
> Physics and Astronomy “Augusto Righi” of the University of Bologna, and the
> Department of Physics and Earth Sciences of the University of Ferrara. 
> 
> For any questions, please contact the organizers at
> dis2026-info@lists.bo.infn.it.
> 
> We look forward to welcoming you to Bologna.
