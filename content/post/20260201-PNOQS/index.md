> Dear Colleagues,
> 
> Applications are now open for the international summer school "Physics
> of Nuclear Open Quantum Systems," which will take place at GANIL,
> Caen, France, from July 6 to July 24, 2026. We kindly ask faculty
> colleagues to circulate this announcement, and strongly encourage
> interested students to apply at:  
> https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/37944/
> 
> To receive full consideration, applications should be completed by
> March 15, 2026.
> 
> The school will focus on modern theoretical approaches to study weakly
> bound and unbound quantum many-body systems. While examples will be
> primarily drawn from the physics of atomic nuclei, the theoretical
> concepts introduced are broadly applicable to all open quantum
> systems. Selected experimental perspectives will be included.
> 
> The program is intended for early-career scientists, including
> Master’s and Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and exceptional
> senior undergraduate students, both theorists and experimentalists.
> Accommodation and meals will be provided to all participants during
> the school.
> 
> We would greatly appreciate your help in distributing this information
> to potential applicants.
> 
> Best regards,
>
