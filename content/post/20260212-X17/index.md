> Dear Colleagues and Friends,
> 
> We cordially invite you to participate in the workshop "The X17 particle, status
> and new ideas", which will take place from March 23 to March 27, 2026 at ECT*,
> Trento (Italy). The main idea is to discuss both past and
> new experimental research and the new advances of the theoretical studies about
> the hypothetical X17 particle.
> 
> Addressed topics include:
> 
> - Discussion of the past experimental research
> - The status of the new experiments
> - High-energy models
> - Bound and constrains due to past experiments
> - Nuclear Physics dynamics and structure entering in the reactions
> - Future Projects
> 
> We kindly invite you to register for the workshop and submit an abstract for a
> talk or poster contribution. The workshop aims to bring together
> experimentalists and theorists to discuss past and ongoing searches, as well as
> new ideas related to the hypothetical X17 particle, leaving ample time for
> discussion and exchange.
> 
> Registration and abstract submission are available at:
> https://www.ectstar.eu/workshops/the-x17-particle-status-and-new-ideas/
> 
> We would also like to draw your attention to a closely related workshop that
> will take place the week before:
> 
> “X17 What if?” Workshop  
> March 19–20, 2026  
> Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, INFN (Italy)
> 
> This workshop will be dedicated to the present and future experimental searches
> for the hypothetical X17 particle and is conceived as a hands-on meeting with
> significant time allocated to open discussions. Further information is available
> at:
> https://agenda.infn.it/event/49565/
> 
> The scientific programmes of the Trento and Frascati workshops are being
> developed in close coordination by the respective organizing committees and will
> be published on the workshop web pages.
> 
> There will be no registration fee for the Trento workshop. Lunches, coffee
> breaks, and a social dinner in downtown Trento will be covered by the workshop
> budget. Participants who may require travel support are kindly asked to indicate
> this in the registration notes; further details will be provided directly.
