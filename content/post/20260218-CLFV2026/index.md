> Dear colleague,
> 
> We are pleased to announce the 5th International Conference on Charged Lepton
> Flavor Violation (CLFV2026).
> 
> The aim of the conference is to bring together theorists and experimentalists
> working in the complementary
> areas of lepton flavor physics, in order to assess the current status of the
> field and discuss future directions.
> 
> Over three days of plenary talks and focused discussions, participants will
> examine the theoretical status of
> charged lepton flavor violation models, review recent experimental results, and
> explore their implications for
> physics beyond the Standard Model. Searches for charged lepton flavor violation
> provide powerful probes of new physics, and the conference will highlight both
> established approaches and emerging ideas shaping the future of the field.
> 
> The conference will take place from June 17 to June 19, 2026, in Rome.
> 
> Further information about the conference is available at:
> https://agenda.infn.it/event/49750/overview
> 
> Feel free to forward this announcement to any potentially interested colleague.
> 
> On behalf of the CLFV2026 Organizing Committee, looking forward to welcoming you
> in Rome,
> 
> S. Giovannella and F. Renga  
> (CLFV 2026 co-chairs)
