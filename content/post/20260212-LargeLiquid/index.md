> Dear colleagues,
> 
> We are organizing a community town hall focused on the physics
> opportunities of large liquid scintillator detectors: charting the path
> beyond tonne-scale neutrinoless double beta decay,
> with an emphasis on organic liquid scintillator–based detector
> approaches, and the rich additional physics program offered by such
> detectors such as DSNB, solar neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and CP violation
> if deployed at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (SURF).
> 
> Establishing sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay in the normal
> neutrino mass ordering is a defining goal for the coming decades. Organic
> liquid scintillator detectors offer a promising route to the large target
> masses and low backgrounds required, while enabling a rich additional
> physics program. Recent advances in detector technology, event
> reconstruction, and background discrimination motivate exploration of
> beyond tonne-scale sensitivity.
> 
> This town hall, held in conjunction with Neutrino 2026, will convene the
> community to discuss the physics case, technical requirements, and R&D
> directions for liquid scintillator–based  searches,
> with an emphasis on inclusive discussion and openness to novel concepts.
> This will be the first in a series of three town halls, with the goal of
> converging on a shared path forward. The goal is to provide an open forum
> that steps back from any single detector proposal and instead focuses on
> physics drivers — detector requirements, enabling technologies, and
> isotope choices.
> 
> Participation is open to the full community, including experimentalists,
> theorists, and early-career researchers. Further details will be announced
> in the coming weeks.
> 
> Save the date: June 19-20th at UC Irvine
> 
> You will be able to register for this meeting when registering for Nu26.
> More information will be available shortly.
