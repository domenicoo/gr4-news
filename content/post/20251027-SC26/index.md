> Dear Colleague,
> 
> We are organizing a two-half-day workshop on advanced topics in perturbative
> QCD, inspired by the scientific legacy of Stefano Catani.  
> The event will take place on January 8 and 9, 2026, at the Galileo Galilei
> Institute in Arcetri, Florence.
> 
> This year's edition will focus on Sudakov resummation. We plan to critically
> compare different resummation approaches, calculations in direct and conjugate
> spaces, in Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) and direct QCD, parton showers
> and automated resummation techniques. We will also discuss the impact of
> resummation on the description of heavy-quark fragmentation and shape variables
> in e+e- annihilation, and its relevance for the accurate determination of the
> strong coupling.
> 
> Confirmed invited speakers include Ugo Aglietti, Thomas Becher,
> Matteo  Cacciari, Stefan Kluth, Frank Krauss, Giovanni Ridolfi and
> Giulia Zanderighi.
> 
> Further details and registration are available on the workshop webpage:
> 
> https://agenda.infn.it/e/SC26
> 
> The schedule will include ample time for discussions to encourage active
> participation from all attendees.
> 
> We look forward to seeing you in Florence next January.

> Best regards,  
> Roberto Bonciani, Leandro Cieri, Daniel de Florian, Prasanna Dhani, Giancarlo
