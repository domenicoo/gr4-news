> We are pleased to announce that we are organizing the mini‑workshop
> "From Lattice to the Lab: Illuminating Kaon Decays", which will be held
> at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati from 24 to 25 March 2026,
> https://agenda.infn.it/event/50498/
> 
> 
> This workshop aims to bring together theorists and experimentalists
> working on various aspects of kaon decays, with a focus on fostering
> interdisciplinary collaboration and advancing precision studies in
> 
> flavor physics.
> 
> 
> Topics will include:
> - radiative kaon decays,
> - rare processes,
> - multi-lepton final states,
> - future prospects in K measurements.
> 
> 
> Special attention will be given to novel lattice QCD approaches and
> their phenomenological implications. The program will feature a hands-on
> session on Monte Carlo generators and radiative corrections, aimed at
> clarifying current methodologies and enhancing analysis tools.
> 
> 
> Contributions from major experimental collaborations—including NA62,
> KLOE/KLOE-2, E36, and LHCb—will be complemented by theoretical insights
> from lattice groups such as BMW, RBC, UKQCD, and ETMC.
> 
> 
> Organizing Committee:
> 
> Matthew Moulson, Silvia Martellotti, Gemma Tinti, Giuseppe Gagliardi,
> Federico Mescia, Francesco Sanfilippo, Nazario Tantalo
> 
> The workshop is part of the activities of the Theoretical Phenomenology
> Visiting Institute@LNF, running from 23 March to 5 April 2026,
> and supported by CSN4 to promote visits to LNF by early‑career scientists.
