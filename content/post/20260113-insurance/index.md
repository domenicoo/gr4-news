While waiting to send a further summary email regarding INFN insurance coverage, I would like to remind you that, in the event of an **ACCIDENT WHILE ON A BUSINESS TRIP** on behalf of INFN, it is important to:

- activate emergency assistance;
- immediately contact **AIG Europe SA** to open the claim and receive support, in accordance with the *“travel abroad coverage”* policy (coverage is also provided in some cases if the work-related accident occurred in Italy – see the policy conditions)
- promptly inform the **Human Resources Office** ([infn@to.infn.it](mailto:infn@to.infn.it)) so that the accident report can be opened.

Any accident (at the workplace during working hours, or while commuting home–work–home, or while away from the workplace on an authorized INFN mission in Italy or abroad) must **always be reported promptly** (no later than **3 days from the event**) to the Human Resources Office in order to activate the required administrative procedure.

For public-sector employees (including grant holders and PhD students), additional coverage can be activated in advance through your local **ASL** (info: *missioni TO* [missioni_to@to.infn.it](mailto:missioni_to@to.infn.it) / [infn@to.infn.it](mailto:infn@to.infn.it)).
