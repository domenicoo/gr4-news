> 
> The goal of the workshop is to bring together the experts working on
> different UV complete approaches to quantum gravity, from string theory to
> various perturbative and non-perturbative approaches. Given the promising
> opportunity to probe quantum gravity effects in the very early Universe with
> future CMB and gravitational wave experiments, we expect the in-depth
> discussions on predictions and self-consistency of low- energy effective
> theories on top of cosmological backgrounds.
> 
> The meeting will be mainly focused on the following directions:  
>  *  Non-perturbative methods, in application to quantum gravity, such as
>     string theory, amplitudes bootstrap, functional renormalisation group,
>     loop quantum gravity, etc.
>  *  Quantum gravity effects in the early Universe: inflation, cosmological
>     correlators, non-gaussianities, gravitational waves.
>  *  EFT of gravity in connection with cosmology and Black Holes.
>  *  other related topics.
> 
> NB: Due to strict limitations in venue capacity and funding availability,
> the number of conference participants is limited. The organizers reserve the
> right to confirm registration requests.
