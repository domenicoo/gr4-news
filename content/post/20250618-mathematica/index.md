> Dear all,
> 
> following my previous message from May, 8th (see below), I am happy to let you know that the new site license for the Wolfram Mathematica software is now available.
> Staff members and students associated with the departments of Physics, Mathematics, INFN, and the "Ferdinando Rossi" school can access the software following the instructions attached to this message.

> Dear all,
> 
> the University of Turin provided a site license for the Mathematica
> software which expired at the end of April. With this license, each
> member of the UniTO community with a @unito.it or a @edu.unito.it email
> address had access to licenses for Mathematica.
> 
> After negotiating with the software distributor (Adalta), the license
> has been renewed for another year by the departments of Physics,
> Mathematics, INFN, and the "Ferdinando Rossi" school. Staff members and
> students associated to these institutions will keep access to the
> software. While waiting for the activation of the new contract, in order
> to use Mathematica you can take the following steps:
> 
> If you already created a Wolfram account linked to your @unito.it or
> @edu.unito.it email address:
> 1) request a temporary activation key, valid for 1 month, using the form
> provided by Adalta on April 24th:
> https://www.adalta.it/wolfram-mathematica-per-unitorino/
> (the email with this link might be in your spam folder)
> 2) after receiving the temporary activation key, start Mathematica and
> go to "Help/Enter Activation Key".
> 3) once the new contract will be active, you will need to create a new
> activation key from your existing Wolfram/UniTO account and enter it in
> the software
> 
> If you never created a Wolfram account linked to your @unito.it or
> @edu.unito.it email address, please wait a few more days/weeks for the
> new contract to be active.
> 
> I will send another message once the new site license is available.
