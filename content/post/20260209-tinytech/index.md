As part of our ongoing *Un Posto Normale initiative*, we are excited to introduce a new resource for the team: the *Tiny Tech* (or *Piccola Elettronica*) station.

Starting today, you can find a selection of essential electronics in Room E17, right by the stationery supplies.

**What’s Available?**  
We’ve stocked the station with the basics to keep you powered and connected:

- Chargers (2x): 70W power delivery, plenty of juice for any laptop.
- USB-C Docks (3x): Multi-port hubs (including a very functional Ethernet port, don't tell anyone!).
- USB Sticks (2x): Dual-head design (USB-A and USB-C).
- Headset (1x): USB-connected for your zoom calls.
- Cables: A variety of USB-C cables for all your devices.

**How it Works**  
Feel free to borrow whatever you need! To help us keep track of everything, please use the log sheet provided:

- Sign Out: Write your name, the item, and the date.
- Return: Simply cross out your entry once the item is back in its place

Have a suggestion? If there’s something else that would make your workday smoother, please let me know.
