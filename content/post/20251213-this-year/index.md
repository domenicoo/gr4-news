Dear friends,

it’s that time of year when we look back, sigh, contemplate, and ruminate on what has happened.  
Of course, I couldn’t avoid doing it myself.  
What follows is an incomplete collection of what happened to our GR4 in Torino.

## New and old members 👥
As of September (*i.e.* before the arrival of the new students and postdocs), we are again the second-largest Group 4 in Italy, with a total of 95 FTE out of 994.  
One theorist out of ten in Italy is in Torino, and only Trieste is slightly larger (summing over University, SISSA, and ICTP).

Two “postdoc for foreigners” fellowships starting in October 2025 were assigned to Torino.  
The local INFN invested a total of 25k€ in cofunding postdoc positions in 2025.

We have been quite successful in this year’s *concorsone* for researcher positions.  
We are looking forward to welcoming *Ivano Basile*, who will join us before summer 2026. 👋  
Our *Nicolò Petri* also won a position, but he is going back to Milano, despite our attempts to convince him to stay.

## Seminars
We've managed to put on a remarkable 61 seminars! That's a super-active pace, roughly one seminar every four working days (if you count 250 working days a year). I don't have the official statistics, but chatting with the other coordinators, it turns out this is likely to be a record in Italy. I honestly think keeping this level of activity going is necessary to have a really active and lively group.

You can find all our appointments at this [📆 link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?height=600&wkst=1&ctz=Europe%2FRome&showPrint=0&title=Theory%20Seminars%20in%20Torino&src=Y180ZHI0bHZzNXRwZjY1ODBhbTRxZTJsaGhzOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&src=Y18zMWUwN2E2MmUyNTliODA4ZGFhOTNlYzZjM2Y3NGExMGE2N2UxMGYzOGNiOTc4OTJjMzg4MWI3NGMzODU4Y2E0QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20&src=Y18xMDlmNjQ3Yjg1MTY2NzRhYWMzM2QxODY4MDIwYTk4YTU5YjFkOWU2NmUxZWE3MTkzMzc1YjRhODgyNTliMDIxQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20&src=Y19mYzMxMzg5MjMyNTY3ZTljNzdkZmE0MjM1OWE4NDY5NGFjNmYwMTUwNjQ4MjljODE2ZmY4ZDhjMzc1OWFjOTA2QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20&src=dG90aGNvbGxvcXVpYUBnbWFpbC5jb20&color=%23F6BF26&color=%23AD1457&color=%23F09300&color=%23616161&color=%233F51B5), 
or on the page https://domenicoo.github.io/gr4-news/calendars

My sincere thanks go to all the seminar organizers (we have 18 of them on our mailing list) and to Eleonora from the INFN secretariat. 🙏  
Without their work, this would not have been possible.

## Conferences

## Santo Stefano 🎶🍷🎓
We are continuing our Santo Stefano Belbo retreat tradition.
The indico page of the 2025 edition is [🔗 here](https://agenda.infn.it/e/SSB25), while  [📸 here](https://cells.infn.it/public/ssb2025photos) you can find the photos.

I’m proud to say that also this year we were kicked out of the restaurant just before 1am because we were making too much noise.  
Compared to the 2023 edition, the number of guitars increased from three to five, and we also acquired a ukulele and a kazoo.
Doing great!

## [Communication breakdown 💥📬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2atkj_KWLl0)
In September, the storage at the computer center crapped out. Yes, that’s the technical expression.  
I won’t comment too much on it, except to note that this was not completely unexpected.

As a result, our mail server died and, even today, three months later, it remains down. 🪦  
As a temporary solution, mail from the @to.infn.it domain has been transferred to CNAF on a spare server.  
We are still waiting for a permanent solution. Well, Prezzolini used to say that  
*“In Italia non c'è nulla di più definitivo del provvisorio e nulla di più provvisorio del definitivo”*.

In spite of our misadventures, I managed to spam you a total of 180 times in 2025. 📬  
That’s roughly once every 1⅓ days.

And to make sure you don’t miss any of my most important messages, since May I’ve set up a shiny website: ✨

Check out the left sidebar: you’ll find useful links and calendars of events in Torino and throughout Italy.

## Operation *un posto normale*
We are continuing our quest to have a *normal place*, whatever that means.

- We have an instruction manual: https://l.infn.it/gr4-to-manual  
  It is a true *living document*, with 41 updates since last December, and it has been consulted over 400 times.
- We keep replacing old computers with new ones. 💻  
  Once at regime, the average machine should be less than three years old.
- We now have a small stationery cabinet available to everyone (office E17). 🗄️

Expected for 2026: a computer accessories (cables, etc.) cabinet and a wall-mounted screen for seminar and other announcements.


Have a great end of the year!  🎉  
Domenico
