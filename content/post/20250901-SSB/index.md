Good news, everyone!

The Santo Stefano Belbo retreat is happening again in 2025!

If you weren’t with us two years ago: every other year we organize a relaxed weekend workshop in Santo Stefano Belbo, a lovely spot not far from Torino. We spend two days together sharing our work, chatting about ideas, enjoying good food, great wine, and just having a nice time as a group (*), helping to spark new conversations and collaborations.

This year, we’ll be going on Saturday and Sunday, November 15–16.

For now, just save the date and feel free to start signing up on our (still in progress) Indico page.

Please keep in mind that you will have to take care of your own accommodation!

Looking forward to another fun and inspiring weekend!

Andrea, Antonio, Domenico & Marco
