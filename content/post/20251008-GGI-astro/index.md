> we gladly announce the 2026 edition of the International PhD School on:
> 
> "Theoretical Aspects of Astroparticle Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation"
> 
> to be held at the Galileo Galilei Institute of Theoretical Physics (GGI,
> Florence, Italy) from 2 to 13 March, 2026.
> 
> Details can be found at the page: https://agenda.infn.it/event/48713/
> 
> Applications can be submitted through the GGI web page (deadline: December

> 
> A limited number of selected PhD students will be admitted.
> 
> The School aims at providing robust and detailed introductions on the basic
> theoretical concepts and main tools to work in the field of Astroparticle
> Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation. The courses are organized as lectures at
> the blackboard in the morning and are integrated with hands-on and
> discussion sessions with an instructor in the afternoon.
> 
> The program of the 2026 edition comprises the following four courses:
> 
> - Elena Pinetti (Flatiron Institute/Simons Foundation): Multi-messenger
> searches for dark matter
> 
> - Davide Gerosa (Milano Bicocca): Gravitational waves from compact binaries
> 
> - Elena Amato (INAF Arcetri): Cosmic Particles
> 
> - Lavinia Heisenberg (Heidelberg): Gravity and theoretical cosmology 
> 
> The School will profit of the Galileo Galilei Institute facilities. Each
> student will have office space to study and discuss, with a lot of
> opportunities to interact with lecturers. Practical information on
> accommodation, support and meals can be found at the School webpage.
> 
>  
> 
> Please circulate this information among colleagues, collaborators and
> students that may be interested in attending the School (apologies if you
