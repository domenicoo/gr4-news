> Dear All,
> 
> We are pleased to announce the forthcoming event of the recently established lecture series "QuanTO - Quantum Lectures in Torino". This joint initiative is the result of the scientific cooperation among researchers from the Departments of Physics and Mathematics of Politecnico di Torino (DISMA-DISAT) and Università di Torino.
> 
> The goal of this series is to bring together physicists and mathematicians interested in quantum theories through regular meetings and advanced lectures on current topics by leading experts. We are particularly committed to engaging students and young researchers with these fascinating areas. Therefore, to encourage broader participation, each conference will be preceded by one or more introductory lectures ("crash course") designed to review the ideas and techniques necessary to fully appreciate the advanced seminar.
> 
> The next event of this series will take place on September 12, 2025. 
> 
> We are pleased to host Professor Roberto Longo from the University of Rome Tor Vergata on this occasion, who will talk about 
> 
> "von Neumann algebras and entropy/energy inequalities in QFT". 
> 
> The event will take place at the Department of Mathematics "G. Peano" (UniTo), Aula Magna (2nd floor), with the following schedule - please find the event leaflet attached:
> 
> - Crash course from 10:30 to 12:30.
> 
> - Seminar from 15:00 to 16:00.
> 
> Abstract: After a brief introduction to operator algebras, I will present new inequalities concerning entropy and energy; in particular, my recent relative entropy/energy ratio local bound in Quantum Field Theory. This bound is model-independent and rigorous; it follows solely from first principles in the framework of translation-covariant, local Quantum Field Theory on the Minkowski spacetime.

> A light lunch will be offered to the participants.
