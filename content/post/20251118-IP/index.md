We are doing our yearly cleanup of the unused IP addresses.  
We have a finite number of IPs *and* by law each of them must be uniquely attributed to a precise person.

Since mistakes can always happen, if your LAN-connected computer (desktop) stops being able to access the internet, please contact me or our central-support@to.infn.it immediately (yes, I do see the catch-22 situation, but I'm positive you can find a way).

Thank you for your cooperation.
