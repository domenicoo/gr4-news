> Dear colleagues and friends,
> 
> with the start of 2026 come exciting announcements, including
> that of the new TALENT course 10: "Nuclear Theory for New
> Physics". It will take place at the ECT* (Trento, Italy) from
> Monday July 13 to Friday July 31 2026 and is organised
> by Vincenzo Cirigliano (INT), Heiko Hergert (FRIB), Emanuele
> Mereghetti (LANL), Saori Pastore (Washington University in St.
> Louis), Maria Piarulli (Washington University in St. Louis), and
> André Walker-Loud (LBNL).
> 
> This TALENT school aims to establish a common ground for nuclear
> theory students in different sub-communities interfacing in the
> study of electroweak and BSM physics with nuclei: phenomenology
> and Effective Field Theory, lattice QCD, and nuclear structure.
> More information can be found here:  
> https://www.ectstar.eu/talents/nuclear-theory-for-new-physics/
> The school is tailored for PhD students and young post-docs with
> in-depth lectures given by world-leading expert in each field
> followed by problem-solving sessions The registration has
> already opened on the Indico website:  
> https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/279/registrations/161/
