> We are pleased to announce the workshop "Higgs @ GGI 2026", which will take
> place from 28 September to 23 October 2026
> at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics (GGI) in Florence,
> Italy.
> 
> The workshop is broadly devoted to Higgs physics, and aims to promote close
> interaction between theory and experiments,
> focusing on precision measurements, theoretical interpretations, precise
> calculations and the prospects for BSM Higgs sectors.
> All of this will be discussed in light of current and future runs of the LHC,
> and looking at the perspective for future colliders following the outline of
> the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.
> 
> The event also features a mini-school and a mini-conference during its first
> week.
> 
> Information on the program, participation, registration, and deadlines
> is available on the event webpage: https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=535
> 
> We kindly invite interested researchers to apply and participate.
