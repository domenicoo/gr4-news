> Dear Colleagues,
> 
> It is our pleasure to announce the opening of registration and abstract
> submission for the 33rd International Workshop on Deep Inelastic Scattering
> and Related Topics (DIS2026), which will be held in Bologna (Italy) from 4
> to 8 May 2026. General information about the workshop was provided in the
> First Bulletin, issued last September. You can now find detailed information
> on registration, student support, travel, and accommodation at
> https://dis2026.infn.it.
> 
> The deadline for abstract submission is 15 January at 23:59 CET. Abstracts
> may be submitted for contributed talks (17+3 minutes) or shorter (8 minutes)
> “flash” talks. Flash talks will replace the traditional poster session and
> are designed to provide early-career scientists with an opportunity to share
> brief research communications. Abstract acceptance will be notified by 15th
> February 2026.
> 
> Early-bird registration fee is 650 € until 15 March 2026, and 800 EUR
> thereafter. For early-career scientists (undergraduate and PhD students),
> the fee is 450 € (600 € after 15 March). The fee includes the welcome
> reception, all lunches, coffee and tea breaks, the social dinner, and an
> excursion in the Bologna city centre. 
> 
> We strongly recommend booking your accommodation well in advance to save
> money and ensure that you find an option suitable to your needs. Please see
> related recommendations on the conference website. We have been informed
> that a major fair will take place in Bologna during the final days of the
> conference, which may make last-minute hotel bookings more difficult and
> more expensive.
> 
> As in previous editions, the 2026 Guido Altarelli Award will be presented
> during DIS2026. The nomination deadline passed last 20 November, and the
> award ceremony will be held on 8 May 2026.
> 
> Finally, we ask a small favor to help us promote DIS2026. Since September,
> we have quietly distributed DIS2026 posters to major laboratories and
> universities through various collaboration meetings. The poster, printed in
> A3 format, remains very readable. We invite you to download a copy and print
> it to help advertise the conference in your department or laboratory.
> 
> We are looking forward welcoming you in Bologna!
