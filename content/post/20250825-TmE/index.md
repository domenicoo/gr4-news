The 2025 edition of the school Theory meets Experiment will be held at GGI from the 10th to the 21st of November 2025
https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=529

Abstract: This school aims to provide the next generation of physicists with
a comprehensive foundation in dark matter direct detection, integrating both
experimental techniques and theoretical models across a wide range of
potential dark matter mass scales. On the theoretical side, students will
explore diverse dark matter production mechanisms and models, equipping them
with the tools necessary to calculate dark matter scattering rates. By
seamlessly connecting theory with experiment, the program will help identify
clear, actionable targets for future experimental endeavors. Covering both
advanced experimental and theoretical topics, the school will foster
essential collaborations between theory and experimentâ€”collaborations that
are crucial for designing the next generation of experiments and shaping the
future directions of dark matter research.
