> Dear Colleagues,
> 
> We are pleased to announce that the [XXI Avogadro Meeting](https://agenda.infn.it/e/XXIAvogadro) on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories will take place in Catania (Italy), on December 17â€“19, 2025. The meeting will be held fully in person.
> 
> The program will include five extended lectures with discussions, one gong-show session, one poster session. Young researchers are especially encouraged to apply for the gong-show and poster sessions. The deadline for registration is November 30, 2025.
> 
> The lecture program will feature:
> 
> 1) Scale separation in string theory  
> Speakers: Fien Apers (IFT, Madrid), Vincent van Hemelryck (Uppsala U.)
> 
> 2) Recent progress in 2d gauge theories  
> Speakers: Diego Delmastro (UCLA), Giovanni Galati (ULB)
> 
> 3) Regge trajectories and light-ray operators  
> Speakers: Alessandro Georgoudis (QMUL), Jeremy Mann (King's College, London)
> 
> 4) Supersymmetric gauge theory methods for gravitational waves  
> Speakers: Cristoforo Iossa (Geneva U.), Giulia Isabella (UCLA)
> 
> 5) SYK-like models and holography in lower dimensions  
> Speakers: Ohad Mamroud (SISSA, Trieste), Jacopo Papalini (Gent U.)
> 
> Registration is already open, and we strongly recommend booking flights and accommodation early, as Catania is a popular destination also during the Christmas period.
> 
> Note also that a number of scholarships to support participation of early-career researchers will be available.
> 
> As in previous editions, we can only cover the costs of the social dinner for a limited number of participants. These will be decided based on the order of registration and are contingent on attendance to the meeting for all three days.
