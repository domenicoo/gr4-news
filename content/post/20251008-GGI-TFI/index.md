> Dear Colleague,
> 
> We are happy to announce the next edition of the Galileo Galilei Institute
> (GGI) School on the Theory of Fundamental Interactions.
> 
> Here is the website for the
> event: https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=550
> 
> The lectures are geared to Ph.D. students in High Energy Particle and
> Astroparticle Physics. The aim of the school is to give a pedagogical
> introduction to the basic concepts and tools needed for research, covering
> the foundations of the subject at a deep and advanced level. The main topics
> include the Standard Model of Particle Physics and its extensions, Collider
> Physics, Quantum Field Theory, and Cosmology.
> 
> Lecturers and topics:
> 
> - Diego BLAS (IFAE Barcelona) -- Quantum sensing for fundamental physics
> 
> - Nathaniel CRAIG (UC Santa Barbara) -- The generalized 't Hooft paradigm
> 
> - Joan ELIAS MIRÃ“ (ICTP Trieste) -- S-matrix bootstrap
> 
> - Shirley LI (UC Irvine) -- Neutrinos in the â€˜20s
> 
> - Geraldine SERVANT (DESY) -- BSM in the Early Universe
> 
> - Jesse THALER (MIT) -- Machine Learning for fundamental physics
> 
> The lectures will be in presence. 
> 
> There will be plenty of time for deep and thorough discussions with the
> lecturers thanks to the offices and discussion room facilities offered by
> the GGI. Also, all the courses will be video-recorded and they will be
