&lt;p&gt;It is with a heavy heart (and a slightly overheated CPU) that we announce the passing of zoroastro, our loyal SSH server and steadfast companion through login storms, accidental rm -rf, and infinite loops since time immemorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of noble serviceâ€”during which zoroastro survived kernel panics, mysterious downtime, and that one time someone tried to mine bitcoins (I&amp;rsquo;m not joking), our venerable server has finally ascended to the great /dev/null in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fear not! From the ashes of zoroastro rises a worthy successor: artaban is now ready to serve all your SSH-ing needs with dignity and RAM to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective immediately, please direct your logins, scripts, and affection to:&lt;br&gt;
ðŸ‘‰ artaban.to.infn.it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the home directory contents are still there and aliases should redirect smoothly. But do check your scripts and cron jobs just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, dear zoroastro you were the SSH server we didnâ€™t deserve but desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>UPS</title><link>https://domenicoo.github.io/gr4-news/p/ups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://domenicoo.github.io/gr4-news/p/ups/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are planning to buy a few UPS (uninterruptible power supplies) to change our aging ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send me a mail if you need one for your office (and please tell people around because some of my emails end up straight to the spam).&lt;/p&gt;
