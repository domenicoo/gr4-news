&lt;p&gt;INFN is currently considering the possibility of signing a national campus license for Mathematica, which would cover all of Italy. This license would replace local agreements and result in significant cost savings overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the proposal only includes access to the cloud version of Mathematica, not the traditional desktop licenses we currently use. For this reason, we first need to figure out if the cloud version is suitable for our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I’m looking for a few volunteers to test it. The department&amp;rsquo;s current license already includes access to Mathematica Cloud, which you can try at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wolframcloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.wolframcloud.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know as soon as possible if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to help and share your feedback on what works and what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to contact me if you need more information.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>UPS</title><link>https://domenicoo.github.io/gr4-news/p/ups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://domenicoo.github.io/gr4-news/p/ups/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are planning to buy a few UPS (uninterruptible power supplies) to change our aging ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send me a mail if you need one for your office (and please tell people around because some of my emails end up straight to the spam).&lt;/p&gt;
